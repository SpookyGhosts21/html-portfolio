<h1>My Go To Movies ! </h1>
<h2>These 3 movies are my top three. Not what I think are the best movies but what have stuck with me. </h2>

<h3>1. The Lord of The Rings (Orginal Trilogy)</h3>
<p>My obsession with lord of the rings stared when my mother took me to see The Two Towers in theaters. I remeber have the books read to me but that movie really brought the world of Tolkin to life for me. 
  I would say that it sparked my love for fantasy and sci-fi. I have seen the movies countless times and read the books several times. I have also explored all the extended Tolkin literary universe.
  I rewatch the movies with my wife every year or so and plan to do so with my daughter. </p>

<h3>2. The Departed</h3>
<p>The Departed is a gripping crime thriller that weaves a complex web of betrayal, loyalty, and survival. Set in the gritty streets of Boston, the film features powerhouse performances from Leonardo DiCaprio,
    Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholson. The tension builds as undercover cop Billy Costigan and mole Colin Sullivan try to outsmart each other in a dangerous game of cat and mouse. With Scorsese’s masterful direction
    and an unpredictable plot, the film delivers both suspense and profound moral questions about identity and deception.</p>
<h3>3. The Boondock Saints</h3>
<p>The Boondock Saints is a cult classic action film that tells the story of two Irish brothers, Connor and Murphy MacManus, who embark on a violent mission to rid Boston of crime. With a unique blend of vigilante 
  justice, dark humor, and stylish action sequences, the film has gained a loyal following. While not without its controversies, it explores themes of justice and morality in a gritty, unconventional way. Willem Dafoe’s 
  performance as the eccentric FBI agent adds an extra layer of intensity to this already adrenaline-filled ride.</p>
